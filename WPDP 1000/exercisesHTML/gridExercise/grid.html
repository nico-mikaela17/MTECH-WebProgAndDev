          <h2>Soccer</h2>
          <p>
            Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is
            a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a
            spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200
            countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular
            sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each
            end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the
            opposing goal.

          <h2>Baseball</h2>
          <p>
            Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine
            players each, who take turns batting and fielding. The batting team
            attempts to score runs by hitting a ball (that is thrown by the
            opposing team's pitcher) with a bat swung by the batter, and then
            running counter-clockwise around a series of four bases: first,
            second, third, and home plate. A run is scored when a player
            advances around the bases and returns to home plate.

          <h2>Basketball</h2>
          <p>
            Basketball is a limited contact sport played on a rectangular court.
            While most often played as a team sport with five players on each
            side, three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one competitions are
            also common. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop 18
            inches (46 cm) in diameter and 10 feet (3.048 m) high that is
            mounted to a backboard at each end of the court. The game was
            invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, who would be the first
            basketball coach of the Kansas Jayhawks, one of the most successful
            programs in the game's history.
